After the events of Super Mario Lost Land, Princess Peach planned a grand celebration for all inhabitants of the Mushroom Kingdom. Suddenly, the sky darkened, and it began to rain vegetables. Through the thick fog, a massive castle emerged between the gray clouds, and Mario recognized itâ€”Subcon! The Dream Kingdom had returned, and Wart himself had been freed from prison. From the castle, three emerald-like gemstones were cast down: the first landed in Lost Land, the second in Atlantis, and the third in the Mushroom Kingdom. Wart used the fourth gemstone, unleashing a colossal shockwave! The three previously mentioned locations were all (sub)converted into total insanity!
Wart's new army attacked directly at the moment of chaos, taking advantage of the naturally different conditions to experience massive growth! This made it easy for them to kidnap the princess and bring her to the Second Subcon. However, due to the mushroom atmosphere, the much bigger Subcon army is now vulnerable to any jump attack. Are you using this new gained knowledge to help Mario rescue his beloved princess and ending Wart's Nightmare?
